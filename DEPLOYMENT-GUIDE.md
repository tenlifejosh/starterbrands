### Step 2: Upload Your Files

**Option A: Using GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)**

2. **Go to your new repository** on GitHub
3. **Click "uploading an existing file"** link
4. **Drag and drop ALL files** from your project folder
5. **Commit message**: "Initial website upload"
6. **Click "Commit changes"**

**Option B: Using Git Command Line**

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd path/to/your/project

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit files
git commit -m "Initial website upload"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/starter-brand-kit.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository** on GitHub
2. **Click the "Settings" tab** (at the top of the repository)
3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** section (in the left sidebar)
4. **Under "Source"**:
   - Select **"GitHub Actions"** (recommended)
   - This will use the automated deployment workflow

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment

1. **Go to the "Actions" tab** in your repository
2. **You'll see a workflow running** (green dot or checkmark when done)
3. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for the deployment to complete
4. **Your website will be live** at: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

## 🌐 Your Live Website

Once deployed, your website will be available at:
```
https://yourusername.github.io/starter-brand-kit
```

**Example**: If your GitHub username is "johnsmith" and repository is "my-business-site":
```
https://johnsmith.github.io/my-business-site
```

## 🔄 Making Updates

To update your website:

1. **Edit files** in your repository (directly on GitHub or locally)
2. **Commit changes** 
3. **Push to main branch**
4. **GitHub Actions automatically rebuilds** and deploys your site
5. **Changes are live** in 2-5 minutes

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**❌ "404 - Page not found"**
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings → Pages
- Ensure you selected "GitHub Actions" as the source
- Wait 5-10 minutes after first deployment

**❌ "Build failed"**
- Go to Actions tab to see the error
- Usually a missing file or syntax error
- Check that all files were uploaded correctly

**❌ "Site not updating"**
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check the Actions tab to ensure deployment completed
- Wait a few minutes for changes to propagate

### Getting Help:

1. **Check the Actions tab** for build errors
2. **Review the README.md** for detailed instructions
3. **GitHub Pages documentation**: https://pages.github.com/
4. **Contact support**: Create an issue in your repository

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Custom Domain (Optional)

To use your own domain (like `www.yourbusiness.com`):

1. **Buy a domain** from any registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. **In repository Settings → Pages**:
   - Add your custom domain
   - Enable "Enforce HTTPS"
3. **Update your domain's DNS** to point to GitHub Pages
4. **Wait 24-48 hours** for DNS propagation

### Performance Optimization

- **Images**: Compress images before uploading
- **Caching**: GitHub Pages automatically handles caching
- **CDN**: GitHub Pages uses a global CDN for fast loading

### Analytics (Optional)

Add Google Analytics:
1. **Get tracking code** from Google Analytics
2. **Add to your HTML** in the `<head>` section
3. **Commit and push** changes

## 📊 What You Get
